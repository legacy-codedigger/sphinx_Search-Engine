Sphinx 0.9.1 installation notes
================================

Supported operating systems
----------------------------

Most modern UNIX systems with a C++ compiler should be able
to compile and run Sphinx without any modifications.

Currently known systems Sphinx has been successfully compiled and
tested on are:

   - FreeBSD 4.x, 5.x
   - Linux 2.x
   - Windows 2000, XP
   - NetBSD 1.6

We hope Sphinx will work on other Unix platforms as well. 
Please report successful platforms via http://shodan.ru/contact/

Required tools
---------------

On UNIX, you will need the following tools to build
and install Sphinx:

   - a working C++ compiler. GNU gcc is known to work.
   - a good make program. GNU make is known to work.

On Windows, you will need Microsoft Visual C/C++ Studio .NET 2003.
Other compilers/environments will probably work as well, but for the
time being, you will have to build makefile or project file yourself.

Installing Sphinx
------------------

1. Extract the distribution archive (haven't you already?)
   and go to the "sphinx-0.9.1" subdirectory:

   $ tar xzvf sphinx-0.9.1.tar.gz
   $ cd sphinx-0.9.1

2. Build the binaries from the source:

   $ make

3. Copy the binaries to the directory you plan to be using them from:

   $ mkdir /usr/local/sphinx
   $ cp indexer search searchd query.php /usr/local/sphinx

Installation problems
----------------------

Compile-time errors like

   In file included from indexer.cpp:14:
   sphinx.h:35:25: mysql/mysql.h: No such file or directory

and link-time errors like

   /usr/bin/ld: cannot find -lmysqlclient

are caused by MySQL include and library files either missing from your
system, or installed in some system-specific directory.

If you are getting compile time errors about missing MySQL include
files, please edit Makefile and specify proper additional include
directories in CCFLAGS variable with -I switch.

If you are getting link time errors, please specify additional library
directories in LDFLAGS variable with -L switch.

Compile-time errors like

   sphinx.cpp:67: error: invalid application of `sizeof' to
      incomplete type `Private::SizeError< false>'

mean that some compile-time type size check failed. This is most
probably due to off_t type being less that 64-bit on your system.
As a quick hack, you can edit sphinx.h and replace off_t with DWORD
in a typedef for SphOffset_t, but note that this will prohibit you
from using full-text indices larger than 2 GB. Even if the hack helps,
please report such issues, providing the exact error message and
compiler/OS details, so I could fix them in next releases.

If the information above doesn't help you, don't hesitate to contact
me via http://shodan.ru/contact/

Quick Sphinx usage guide
-------------------------

To use Sphinx, you need to:

1. Create a configuration file.

   Default configuration file name is sphinx.conf. A sample configuration
   file, sphinx.conf.in, which has all the options documented, is provided
   with the distribution. Copy that file to your sphinx.conf and edit it:

   $ cp sphinx.conf.in /usr/local/sphinx/sphinx.conf
   $ vi /usr/local/sphinx/sphinx.conf

2. Run the indexer to create full-text index from your data:

   $ cd /usr/local/sphinx
   $ ./indexer

3. Run the command-line client to query the newly created index:

   $ cd /usr/local/sphinx
   $ ./search test

To use Sphinx from your PHP scripts, you need to:

1. Run the search daemon which your script will talk to:

   $ cd /usr/local/sphinx
   $ ./searchd

2. Run the attached PHP API test script:

   $ cd /usr/local/sphinx/api
   $ php test.php test

3. Include the API (it's located in api/sphinxapi.php) and use from
   your own scripts.

Happy searching!
